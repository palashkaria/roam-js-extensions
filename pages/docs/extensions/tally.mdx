import { DemoTallyCounter } from '../../../src/components/TallyCounter';

The script is not configurable

Type `{{tally}}` into a block. The component that is rendered will be a tally counter that supports incrementing and decrementing!

To save a value, or set an initial starting value for the counter, create a child block with the specified value.

### Playground

<DemoTallyCounter />
