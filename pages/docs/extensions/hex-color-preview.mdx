All you have to do is have the extension installed. Anytime you create a valid hex color tag, it will render a colored preview next to the tag.

To change the CSS styling of the preview, you'll want to change the CSS associated with the `roamjs-hex-color-preview` class.

By default, this extension accepts hexes of all lengths. To configure only accepting specific lengths, create a block in the `roam/js/hex-color-preview` page with the text "Include Lengths". For every length you'd like supported, create a child with that number. So if you only want hex codes with length 6 to be rendered, your blocks should be:

- Include Lengths
    - 6
