The script is not configurable

In a block, type `{{article}}`. Similar to date picker, there will be an overlay that appears next to the article button. There will be a text input where you paste in the article's URL. Then, you could hit the `IMPORT` button and the contents of the article will be imported into your Roam DB!

The extension is making it's best guess on what content from the link is considered the article and what isn't. To help improve the extension over time, send article links that did not quite format correctly to support@roamjs.com.
